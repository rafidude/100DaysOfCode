Make Users Awesome

What's the difference about the bestsellers?
What are the attributes of the long-term best sellers?

Define quality as a drive for desirability. So if desirability is the goal, what makes it happen?

Somebody mentions something they love and could not do without. Sustained best sellers are recommended.
92% trust friends, family. 70% trust consumer reviews.

They like the product because they like themselves. Product makes them awesome.

Build products that inspire users to talk about themselves
What does it mean to be a successful user?

True sustained desirability = badass
Do not focus on what the user thinks of you, but what the product enables user to think of himself. They use the product because they like themselves...they tell their firends because they like their friends.

We want robust, fault tolerant users
Design for badass users

What is the larger more meaningful context?

How will users review your product/service on Amazon? What would they say about themselves NOT your product?
Design for that
Design for user's users (audience, friends, colleagues). How can we enable users become more successful, so others are impressed about them?
What do they do after using your product? Desirability is the side effect...

It is much better to be really really good at something
Make users experts...
Experts perform in a superior way, more reliably than experienced non-experts
experts do them consistently, better actions/choices

****Experts are not what they know, but what they do**** DO DO DO **** NOT learn learn learn***

Expert: 10000 hrs of doing very specific thing
Books: Drive + Talent Code
