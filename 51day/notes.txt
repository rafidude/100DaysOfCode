Make sure you have a clear, verifiable, quantifiable goal.
Make sure youâ€™ve set realistic expectations for all stakeholders.

Use read_table() to load small, structured datasets into R.

Take the time to examine your data before diving into the modeling.
The summary command helps you spot issues with data range, units, data type,
and missing or invalid values.
Visualization additionally gives you a sense of data distribution and relation- ships among variables.
Visualization is an iterative process and helps answer questions about the data. Time spent here is time not wasted during the modeling process.
